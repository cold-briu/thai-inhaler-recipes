## 🔬 Alternative Extraction Methods

- **Fermentation Extraction 🍶**  
  - Submerge chopped herbs in a 5–10% sugar–water solution in a sealed jar  
  - Allow to ferment at room temperature (25–30 °C) for 7 days, shaking gently once daily  
  - Strain out solids and evaporate excess moisture to concentrate the aromatic extract  
  - Yields a mild, water-soluble aroma; no heat means delicate compounds remain intact

- **Steam Distillation 💨**  
  - Place fresh or dried herbs in a distillation vessel with a 2:1 water-to-herb ratio  
  - Pass steam through herbs for 2–3 hours at boiling temperature  
  - Condense vapor to separate essential oil (floating layer) and hydrosol (aqueous layer)  
  - Typical essential-oil yield: 0.5–3% by weight; ideal for pure, concentrated aroma

- **Solvent Extraction 🧪**  
  - Soak powdered or coarsely chopped herbs in 95% food-grade ethanol at a 1:5 herb-to-solvent weight ratio  
  - Seal and macerate for 7–14 days, agitating gently every 1–2 days  
  - Filter out plant solids and evaporate ethanol partially to obtain a potent tincture  
  - Captures both water- and oil-soluble compounds; fast and efficient but requires careful alcohol handling

- **Oil Infusion 🌻**  
  - Combine dried herbs with a neutral vegetable oil (e.g., palm or coconut) at a 1:1–1:2 weight ratio  
  - Warm-infuse under low heat (40–60 °C) or sunlight for 4–5 days, stirring once daily  
  - Strain through fine cloth to remove herb particles  
  - Produces a lipophilic extract rich in fatty-soluble aromas; simple DIY method

- **Supercritical CO₂ Extraction 🌐**  
  - Load herbs into an extraction chamber and apply CO₂ at 100–300 bar pressure and 40 °C temperature  
  - Maintain extraction for 1–2 hours, then gradually reduce pressure to collect pure extract  
  - Yields high-purity, thermolabile compound preservation without solvent residues  
  - Ideal for premium formulations but requires specialized equipment
